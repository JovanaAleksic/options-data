# IBKR SPY Options Data Collector

This repository contains code for collecting SPY options data from Interactive Brokers (IBKR) during market hours on trading days.

## Overview

The project automatically collects SPY options data through the Interactive Brokers API using the `ib_insync` library. It is focusing on options with strikes within 30% of the current SPY price and the 0 DTE, 1 DTE expiration dates and last two LEAP expiration dates, gathering complete pricing information including Greeks, every 3 minutes.


## Data Collection Process

The data collection script (`options_creation.py`) connects to IBKR, fetches options data, and saves it to CSV files with the following features:

- Runs every 3 minute during US market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time)
- Only collects on weekdays that aren't US market holidays
- Maintains both historical and latest snapshots of data
- Includes all Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega) 

### Technical Details

- Collects options with strikes within +/- 30% of current SPY price
- Captures short term options: 0DTE and 1DTE 
- Captures long term options: last two LEAP expiration dataes
- Includes both calls and puts
- Tracks full option contract details and pricing metrics

## Dataset

The collected data is stored in two CSV files:

1. `options_spy_historical.csv`: Contains all historical data points with timestamps
2. `options_spy_latest.csv`: Contains only the most recent data collection
3. 
### Data Collection Status

ðŸ”´ **Active Collection in Progress**

The dataset is currently being actively collected and will be updated regularly. 

### Data Fields

The dataset includes numerous fields for each option contract:

- **Contract Information**: Symbol, strike price, expiration date, right (call/put), etc.
- **Pricing Data**: Bid, ask, last price, sizes, volume
- **Greeks**: Delta, gamma, theta, vega for bid, ask, last, and model prices
- **Timestamps**: When each data point was collected

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- ib_insync
- pandas
- schedule
- pytz
- Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway running with API connections enabled

## Installation

```bash
pip install ib_insync pandas schedule pytz
```

## Usage

1. Ensure IBKR Trader Workstation or IB Gateway is running and accepting API connections on port 7497, or adjust the port number within the script
2. Run the data collection script:

```bash
python options_creation.py
```

The script will automatically:
- Check if it's a trading day
- Schedule collections for market hours
- Save data every 3 minutes
- Sleep efficiently between collections

## Notes

- The script connects to IBKR API at localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 7497 with clientId=1
- Modify the connection parameters if needed for your setup
- The script handles connection errors and will log issues without crashing
- Data is appended to the historical file to prevent loss if the script restarts
